1. logic circuit to create pi to 5 or so decimal places [FPGA]
2. Math with LED's (0-9 LED's, give it some form of arithematic and it shows the answer)[STM or FPGA]
--also able to make a binary counter to show the math
3. LED's on an output register (x8) with 4 switches. Do "some logic" and display
the updates from comibnatorial logic [FPGA], showcases the real time aspect
four in -> 8 out. multiplexer? Be creative.
4. STM using one ADC channel to do a FTT or real time DFT(rolling if possible)
**5. Program a SPIE, I2C, USB, CAN, Ethernet... some sort of bus. Implement one of these buses on the 
FPGA and implment one on the STM-32 and make them talk to each other.
--We're able to mix and match! One could do a number 2 project implemented with a number 5 project
That would be two projects.
6. Sine wave production via FPGA (Use of look up tables, this can produce dual or pure tones, 
depending on how you use the PWM)
7. Dial tones (use of dual tones with multiharmonics, this would take a lot of look-up tables)
8. Linux project: Rasperry Pi/Orange Pi/NXP implement an I2C bus inside linux +Virtual memory
9. Using PWM to control MOSFET to set voltage on outputs. Basically creating a DC to DC converter
10. Maximum power point tracking (such as that used with Solar Arrays)


** is mandatory for the semester.
